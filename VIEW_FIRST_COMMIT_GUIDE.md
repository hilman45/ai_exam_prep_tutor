# Guide: Viewing Your First Commit Safely

This guide will help you view and run your first commit without affecting your current code.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Backup Branch (Safety First!)
This creates a snapshot of your current code so you can always return to it.

```powershell
cd c:\ai_prep_tutor\ai-exam-prep-tutor
git branch backup-current-code
```

### Step 2: Note Your Current Branch
You're currently on `master` branch. Remember this!

### Step 3: Checkout the First Commit
This will put you in "detached HEAD" state - meaning you're viewing an old commit, not on a branch.

```powershell
git checkout 3fa1032a
```

**Note:** You'll see a message like "You are in 'detached HEAD' state". This is normal and safe!

### Step 4: Run the First Commit Version
Now you can run your application from the first commit state:

**For Backend:**
```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**For Frontend:**
```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Return to Your Current Code
When you're done showing your lecturer, return to your current code:

```powershell
# Go back to master branch (your current code)
git checkout master

# Or if you want to go to your backup branch
git checkout backup-current-code
```

### Step 6: Verify You're Back
Check that you're back to your latest code:

```powershell
git log --oneline -5
```

You should see your latest commits at the top.

## Alternative: Create a Temporary Branch for First Commit

If you prefer to work on a branch instead of detached HEAD:

```powershell
# Create and checkout a branch from first commit
git checkout -b show-first-commit 3fa1032a

# Run your app here...

# When done, return to master
git checkout master

# Delete the temporary branch if you want
git branch -d show-first-commit
```

## Quick Reference Commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| View first commit | `git checkout 3fa1032a` |
| Return to current code | `git checkout master` |
| List all branches | `git branch` |
| View commit history | `git log --oneline` |
| See current commit | `git log -1` |

## Important Notes

1. **Your current code is SAFE** - Git doesn't delete anything when you checkout old commits
2. **Untracked files** (like `.next/` and `node_modules/`) won't be affected
3. **You can always return** using `git checkout master`
4. **If you make changes** in detached HEAD state, they won't affect your master branch
5. **Local branches vs GitHub**: The `backup-current-code` branch is **local only** - it won't appear on GitHub unless you push it (see below)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: What if I accidentally make changes in the old commit?**
A: Just run `git checkout master` - your changes won't be saved unless you create a branch.

**Q: How do I know which commit I'm on?**
A: Run `git log -1` or `git status` - it will show your current position.

**Q: Can I show multiple commits to my lecturer?**
A: Yes! Just checkout different commit hashes: `git checkout <commit-hash>`

**Q: Why don't I see `backup-current-code` branch on GitHub?**
A: The backup branch is **local only** - it exists on your computer but not on GitHub. This is actually fine since it's just a safety backup. If you want to push it to GitHub (optional):

```powershell
# Push the backup branch to GitHub
git push origin backup-current-code
```

**Note:** You don't need to push it - it works perfectly fine as a local backup!

**Q: Error "untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout" when switching back?**
A: This happens when you have untracked files (like `next-env.d.ts` or build files) that conflict with files in the branch you're checking out. Solution:

```powershell
# Remove the conflicting file (it's auto-generated, safe to delete)
Remove-Item frontend\next-env.d.ts

# Or if it's a build folder:
Remove-Item frontend\.next -Recurse -Force

# Then checkout again
git checkout master
```

**Note:** Files like `next-env.d.ts` are auto-generated by Next.js and will be recreated when you run `npm run dev`, so it's safe to delete them.
