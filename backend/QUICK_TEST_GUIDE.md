# Quick Test Guide for Fixed Summarization Endpoint

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **File ID Issue**: The upload endpoint was generating random UUIDs instead of returning actual Supabase file IDs
2. **Authentication Issue**: The summarization endpoint was using service key instead of user token for RLS compliance

## 🚀 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Upload a New File
Since the file ID issue was fixed, you need to upload a **new file** to get a proper file ID:

1. Go to `/files/upload_file` in Swagger
2. Upload your test file again
3. **Copy the new `file_id`** from the response

### Step 2: Test Summarization
1. Go to `/ai/summarize/{file_id}` 
2. Paste the **new file_id** from Step 1
3. Execute the request

## 🎯 Expected Results

**Upload Response:**
```json
{
  "file_id": "actual-uuid-from-supabase",
  "message": "File uploaded and text extracted successfully",
  "filename": "your-file.pdf",
  "text_length": 1234
}
```

**Summarization Response:**
```json
{
  "summary_id": "summary-uuid",
  "summary_text": "Generated summary of your document...",
  "cached": false,
  "filename": "your-file.pdf"
}
```

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

If you still get 404 errors:

1. **Check the file_id format**: Should be a UUID like `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`
2. **Verify authentication**: Make sure you're logged in and the token is valid
3. **Check server logs**: Look for any error messages in the terminal where the server is running

## 📝 Quick Test File

Create a simple test file `test.txt`:
```
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms 
that can learn from data. It includes supervised learning, unsupervised learning, 
and reinforcement learning approaches. Common applications include image recognition, 
natural language processing, and predictive analytics.
```

This should generate a good summary for testing!
