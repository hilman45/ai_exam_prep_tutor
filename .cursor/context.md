# ðŸ“˜ Project Context â€” AI Exam-Prep Tutor (FYP)

## Purpose & Goal
Build an **AI Exam-Prep Tutor** that helps students prepare for exams by:
- Uploading lecture notes (PDF, DOCX, TXT, images â†’ OCR â†’ text).
- Generating **summaries, quizzes, and flashcards**.
- Saving generated content so users can access it anytime later.
- Allowing users to delete notes, summaries, quizzes, or flashcards.

The project is structured like a SaaS app but will run locally (not deployed for now).

## Problems Being Solved
- Students struggle with information overload â†’ AI summarizes lecture notes.
- Past-paper style quizzes are scarce â†’ AI generates practice quizzes.
- Flashcards take time to make manually â†’ AI generates them automatically.
- Students want access later â†’ all results are saved for reuse or deletion.

## Features
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (email/password).
- **Upload Notes**: PDF, DOCX, TXT, Image â†’ extract text.

## Key Considerations
- Must handle **token limits** â†’ split (chunk) long text before sending to model.
- Security â†’ only owner can access their uploaded files and results.
- UX â†’ progress indicators, error messages, clear UI.
- Extensibility â†’ schema should allow analytics tracking in the future.
